    <h3> Description</h3>
    <p><strong>Pizza Funghi</strong> is one of the simplest and tastiest pizzas
        that you can make yourself! You will need the following:
    </p>
    <p><h4>Toppings</h4></p>
    <div class="ingredients">
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1/4 onion, sliced</li>
        <li>150 gramms of mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>2 sprigs thyme</li>
        <li> <strong>1 dough ball</strong></li>
        <li>100 gramms of Panna</li>
        <li>Cracked black pepper</li>
        <li>a little bit of provolone</li>
        <li>Grated Grana Padano cheese</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Place pizza stone on top rack in over and preheat to 220 degrees Celsium</li>
        <li>Place a pan over medium heat and add 1/2 the oil. Add onion. Season with salt and pepper and saute until translucent. Reduce heat to low cook until caramelized to dark brown, about 30-45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place another pan over medium heat and add remaining oil. Add mushrooms and cook until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Fold 1/2 the caramelized onions and thyme into mushrooms</li>
        <li>Form dough ball into pizza using traditional "slap" method. To do this, make fists and place dough on top. Using knuckles, gently pull dough outward from center until desired consistency is reached. Be sure to leave an outer edge for crust.</li>
        <li>Ladle panna onto piyya, spreading evenly over the surface and making sure to leave pronounced crust. Season with cracked black pepper to taste. Spread mushrooms and onions evenly on top of panna, making sure everything is evenly distributed to prevent pizza from tearing in oven.</li>
        <li>Transfer to oven and bake for 7-10 minutes, or until crust is browned on bottom and cheese is melted. Remove from oven and grate Grana Padano over Pizza to finish</li>
